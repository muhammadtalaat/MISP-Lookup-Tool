# MISP-Lookup-Tool
The MISP Lookup Tool is a PowerShell script that allows users to perform bulk lookups of IP addresses in MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform) instances. It takes a list of IP addresses from a TXT input file, queries the specified MISP instance for each IP address, and exports the results to a CSV file.
